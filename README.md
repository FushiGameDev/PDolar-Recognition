<h2>Description</h2>
This tool provides a fast method for recognizing user drawings or movements. It captures cursor movements as point clouds, enabling recognition of 2D shapes regardless of their rotation or scale. For more details, refer to the official documentation.

The included demo of the asset simplifies creating new datasets by allowing you to draw and save point clouds directly. In my project, I adapted this for Android devices to refresh and enhance functionality. My primary goal was to detect whether a drawn object is a triangle. If a triangle is recognized, the tool responds with appropriate text and a confidence score.
